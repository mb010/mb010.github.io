Hello! Welcome to my personal academic webpage. I research applied AI.

I am interested in many things including language in science, multimodal models, robustness, generalisability and more. I think a lot about about data manifolds, symmetries, and priors.
Feel free to reach out!

You can find lists of my publications in various stages of up-to-date-ness in the following places (with decreasing likelihood to be up to date): [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q7ziv7YAAAAJ), my [CV (resume)](./cv), my [publications page](./publications).

I will be submitting my PhD from the 
[University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) supervised by
[Prof. Anna Scaife](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/anna.scaife.html)
by September of 2024.

See my [research page](/research/) for an outdated, non-technical, and non-exhaustive outline of some of my previous research areas. My most recent work on language in radio astronomy also had a [press release](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/astronomers-create-ai-to-better-communicate-their-stellar-research/) which outlines the core ideas for a non-specialist audience.

###### SKAO-JBCA ML Club

I chair a monthly machine learning club in partnership with colleagues the
[SKAO](https://www.skatelescope.org/). Our goals are to:
  - *Build* a community of researchers who are willing and able to support one another,
  - *Disseminate* the scientific value of ML to our community,
  - *Discuss* ML tools and their potential applications.

For previous ML Club sessions notes, please see:
[ML Club's website](https://jbca-machinelearning.github.io/).
