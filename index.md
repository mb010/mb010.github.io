I am a PhD researcher at the
[University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) supervised by
[Prof. Anna Scaife](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/anna.scaife.html)
working on AI and Radio Astronomy.
Feel free to reach out!

My research interests include AI, deep learning, robustness, generalisability, augmentations and radio astronomy. I aim to outline these for the non-technical reader on my [Research](/research/) page.

###### SKAO-JBCA ML Club

I run a monthly machine learning club in partnership with my colleagues
Dr. Alex Clarke and Dr. Philippa Hartley at the [SKAO](https://www.skatelescope.org/). Our goals are to:
  - Build a *community* of researchers who are willing and able to support one another,
  - *Disseminate* the scientific value of ML to our community,
  - *Discuss* ML tools and their potential applications.

For previous ML Club sessions notes, please see the 
[ML Club's website](https://jbca-machinelearning.github.io/).
