Hello! My name is Micah.

I research AI for Astronomy.
I am interested in developing AI approaches which improve robustness and generalisability of models.
I think a lot about about data manifolds, symmetries, and priors.
Feel free to reach out!

For a list of my publications, see my [CV](./cv), [publications page](./publications), or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q7ziv7YAAAAJ).

I am a PhD researcher at the
[University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) supervised by
[Prof. Anna Scaife](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/anna.scaife.html).

See my [research page](/research/) for a non-technical and non-exhaustive outline of some of my research.

###### SKAO-JBCA ML Club

I chair a monthly machine learning club in partnership with colleagues the
[SKAO](https://www.skatelescope.org/). Our goals are to:
  - Build a *community* of researchers who are willing and able to support one another,
  - *Disseminate* the scientific value of ML to our community,
  - *Discuss* ML tools and their potential applications.

For previous ML Club sessions notes, please see:
[ML Club's website](https://jbca-machinelearning.github.io/).
