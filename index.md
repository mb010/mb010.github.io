Hi, I'm Micah. 

I work on self-supervised learning, masked modelling, language, multimodal learning, and astrophysics. See my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q7ziv7YAAAAJ) profile for a list of my publications. My research interests span many fields including robustness, representation learning, multimodal learning, language modelling in science, self-supervised learning, equivariance, and explainability. I think a lot about data manifolds, symmetries, and priors.

For more on my research, see my [department page](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/bowlesm), where I highlight some of my research projects.

Feel free to reach out by email: `firstname.lastname(at)physics.ox.ac.uk`.



All of my work is publicly tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/mb010).
