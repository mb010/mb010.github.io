My research tends towards deep learning (AI),
radio astronomical imaging, and astronomy outside
of our own galaxy. I am funded through the UK's STFC and
[the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

# Why do I do what I do?
I will be telling you more about my research here soon.

# Artificial Intelligence
### It's happening.

# Radio Astronomy
### It's beautiful.

# Cosmic Magnetism
### It's crazy.
